The AESM1440 Multiphase Flow in Porous Rock course at TU Delft focuses on fundamental physics and numerical methods for gas, liquid, and solid transport in porous media, crucial for geo-energy (geothermal, CO2 storage, hydrogen). Expect to cover Darcy's Law, fractional flow, rock mechanics (compressibility, stress), pore-scale physics, and advanced CFD/simulation techniques (Finite Volume, Riemann solvers) for modeling fluid movement, often linking theory with practical lab/field applications in subsurface energy challenges.
