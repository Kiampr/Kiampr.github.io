In this talk, I will discuss our work on developing a predictive numerical framework for simulating and monitoring single-well closed-loop geothermal systems. Deep dry rock geothermal resources offer an abundant and low-carbon source of sustainable energy, but their commercial viability is often limited by the high capital costs—especially those associated with drilling and well completion. The single-well closed-loop concept presents a promising alternative that significantly reduces drilling requirements, thereby lowering capital investment and improving the economic attractiveness of geothermal projects for investors.

I will present a general multi-segment well model built within an unstructured grid framework, where the wellbore is discretized in a manner similar to a finite-volume reservoir grid. Total velocity is treated as an additional nonlinear unknown constrained by a momentum balance equation. To efficiently solve the highly nonlinear governing equations for both the reservoir and well, we apply operator-based linearization (OBL) techniques, which substantially reduce computational cost.

This framework has been tested across multiple complex physical kernels, including thermal, compositional, and multiphase flow and transport. The model has been validated through comparisons with both analytical solutions and high-resolution numerical benchmarks, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness for simulating closed-loop geothermal systems.
