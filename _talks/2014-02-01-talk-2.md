In this talk, I will discuss a novel approach for simulating CO₂ utilization and storage (CCUS) in subsurface reservoirs with complex heterogeneous structures. Accurately modeling multiphase compositional flow and transport in such reservoirs is challenging due to the highly nonlinear behavior arising from complex thermodynamics and the appearance and disappearance of multiple phases. While conventional machine learning methods have been applied to solve nonlinear computational problems, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a promising alternative by enabling the solution of partial differential equations without requiring large labeled datasets. In this work, I present a sequential training strategy for PINNs, where the network is trained over successive time segments rather than the entire time domain at once. This approach improves accuracy for two-phase transport problems and is further extended to more complex compositional scenarios, capturing nonlinear phase transitions more effectively. Our method was validated on both miscible and immiscible test cases, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to standard PINN training.
