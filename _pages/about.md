Hi there! My name is Kiarash. I hold a Ph.D. from TU Delft (Delft University of Technology), where I specialized in mathematical modeling of coupled wellbore and reservoir systems in the subsurface and developed nonlinear solvers for compositional transport. During my Ph.D., I also explored physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and AI-based approaches for simulating multiphase flow and transport in complex geological systems.

After completing my Ph.D., I have been working as a reservoir engineer in consultancy, focusing on digital twin development and applying my expertise in subsurface modeling to real-world engineering problems. Currently, I am also concentrating on AI and machine learning applications and actively learning about Generative AI to explore innovative solutions in engineering and subsurface systems.
