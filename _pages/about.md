Hi there, My name is Kiarash, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Zanjan in Iran and completed my master’s degree in Energy Engineering focused on chemical processes at Politecnico di Milano in Italy. Following my graduate studies, I pursued a Ph.D. at TU Delft in subsurface modeling within the Department of Geoscience \& Engineering, specializing in mathematical modeling and optimization of coupled multiphysics phenomena for energy transition. I defended my Ph.D. in October 2023. Currently, I work as a reservoir engineer, where I apply my expertise in subsurface modeling and optimization to improve reservoir performance.\newline
